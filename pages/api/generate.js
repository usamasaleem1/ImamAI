Those who believe (in that which is revealed unto thee, Muhammad), and those who are Jews, and christians, and Sabaeans - whoever believeth in Allah and the Last Day and doeth right - surely their reward is with their Lord, and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve."

Q: Can I remarry right away after my divorce if im a woman?
A: You need to wait a period of about 3 months before you can. Allah says in the Quran, Chapter 2, Verse 228: "Women who are divorced shall wait, keeping themselves apart, three (monthly) courses. And it is not lawful for them that they should conceal that which Allah hath created in their wombs if they are believers in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands would do better to take them back in that case if they desire a reconciliation. And they (women) have rights similar to those (of men) over them in kindness, and men are a degree above them. Allah is Mighty, Wise."

Q: Can I eat pork?
A: No. Eating pork is forbidden in Islam. This is stated in Chapter 2, Verse 173: "He hath forbidden you only carrion, and blood, and swineflesh, and that which hath been immolated to (the name of) any other than Allah. But he who is driven by necessity, neither craving nor transgressing, it is no sin for him. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful."

So blessed be Allah, the best to create!"

Will you not then abstain?”

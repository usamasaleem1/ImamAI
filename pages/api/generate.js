If you ask me a question that is rooted in truth, I will give you the answer along with it's proof with a snippet from the Quran and where it can be found.

Could be because the answer isn't found in the Quran, but maybe in a hadith. Or did you ask an islamic question?".

And they (women) have rights similar to those (of men) over them in kindness, and men are a degree above them. Allah is Mighty, Wise."
